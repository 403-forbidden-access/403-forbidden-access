- âš¡ Fun fact:Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is often credited with writing the first algorithm intended for implementation on a computer in the mid-1800s. Her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, laid the foundation for modern computing! Feel free to modify it or let me know if you need something different!
